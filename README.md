The main R file will be Data Viz Challenge 1.R

The other .csv files are my adjustment for the data got from World Bank Development Indicator (WDI Data).
I use parameters as follow:
1. Percent Renewables Consumption in 2015
2. Population in 2015
3. Total Energy Use (MTOE) per capita in 2015
4. GDP PPP from 1990 - 2015  (2011 US$ Constant)
5. PPP per Capita in 2015

the source could be achieved from https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/WDI_csv.zip.

I don't attached the file here because it is 180 MB in size and better if you just see the source directly.
Cheers guys :)
